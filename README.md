# Building a Neural Network from Scratch 

## Overview

This project consists of a Jupyter Notebook implementing a neural network from scratch. Inspired by the video [*The Spelled-Out Intro to Neural Networks and Backpropagation*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0), the notebook focuses on demystifying how neural networks work by breaking down the process into manageable steps.

Rather than relying on frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, this project manually implements the entire workflow, from initialization to training. This approach offers deep insight into the mechanics of forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization, making it an excellent resource for students, educators, and developers keen to understand the foundations of machine learning.

The notebook includes:

- Mathematical foundations behind neural networks.
- Code walkthroughs for every step of the implementation.
- Example problems showcasing how a simple neural network can learn and make predictions.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook and follow along, you need the following:

1. **Python (3.7 or higher)**: The implementation is compatible with modern Python versions.
2. **Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab**: This provides an interactive environment to run and explore the code.

3. **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations. Install it with:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```
4. **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization. Install it with:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```


## Concepts Covered

This notebook provides a thorough walkthrough of the following key topics:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Setting up the weights and biases for each layer of the neural network.
    - Discussion of random initialization and its impact on training.
2. **Forward Pass**:
    - Understanding how data flows through the network.
    - Implementing activation functions such as Sigmoid and ReLU.
3. **Loss Function**:
    - Calculation of errors using loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross-Entropy Loss.
4. **Backpropagation**:
    - Deriving gradients manually using the chain rule.
    - Propagation of errors back through the network layers to update parameters.
5. **Gradient Descent**:
    - Using computed gradients to iteratively update weights and biases.
    - Understanding hyperparameters like learning rate and their effect on convergence.
6. **Experimentation**:
    - Testing the network on a toy dataset.
    - Observing how the network learns through visualizations.

By the end of the notebook, users will have a strong conceptual and practical understanding of how a neural network works, paving the way for exploring advanced architectures and optimization techniques.
